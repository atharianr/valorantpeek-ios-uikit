A former firefighter and soldier from Baltimore, Byrne is fiercely loyal to all his allies and organizations, always keeps his squadmates close. But although he would do anything for them, Byrne hasn't always been able to save everyone. After the death of a close friend, Tariq Porter, his loss greatly affected Byrne, haunted by what had happened despite all his own best efforts to save him. It was around this time that he would then join Kingdom Corporation, giving him something at a time when he needed it most. Byrne would go on to become a veteran of Kingdom's K-SEC branch, once again developing a strong loyalty to his employer.",
